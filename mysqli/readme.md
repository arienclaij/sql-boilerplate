# SQL Boilerplate :: MySQLi

Here you can see the connection and execution of the most common queries in MySQLi. 
The manual about MySQLi can be found here: http://php.net/mysqli

MySQLi can be used in two ways. Via the procedural method (just with functions) or 
via the MySQLi class (recognizable by the object-arrows like -> ).

I recommend using the MySQLi class, since MySQL is made for that, and classes are more flexible.
